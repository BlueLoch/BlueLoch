                    <p>
                        BlueLoch's story began in the Summer of 2023. Having studied software development throughout our
                        school and college careers, we had seen the many failings of today's software development
                        industry. From old technologies, to slow ways of working, we believed we could do better. And
                        so, in July of that year, we formed BlueLoch in the hopes of one day becoming a leader in our
                        industry.

                    <p>
                        We quickly picked up our first client, developing a mobile app for <a
                            href="https://www.redagile.com/">RedAgile</a> to use with their courses on the Agile work
                        methodology. During this time we established our three key values: <b>quality</b>,
                        <b>inclusiveness</b> and <b>efficiency</b>.

                            The quality of our software is what sets us apart. Every aspect of every piece of our
                            software is thoroughly tested before it is published. For you, that means less time worrying
                            about things going wrong and more time focusing on what matters.

                            you don't like, all you have to do is tell us and we'll fix it.
