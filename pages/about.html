				<h2>Our story</h2>
				<p>Whether it be the software frameworks they used, or their work methodoloy, for a long time many
					businesses have worked in outdated ways. The Waterfall method of development is a relic of an older
					age when communication was more difficult, and older frameworks lead to issues when paired with
					newer technology generating egregious costs to rectify.</p>

				<p>That's where we wanted to be different. Being shown where other companies failed at university, we
					believed we could do it better. That's why we formed BlueLoch in July of 2023 with the mission of
					being a leader in modern development methodologies while utilising the latest innovations in the
					software
					development industry.</p>

				<h2>How we work</h2>
				<p>At BlueLoch, we work with what's called the Agile method. With older work methodologies, such as
					Waterfall, a team would develop the full product before showing the client the results. This led to
					many problems, including budget overflows and significant delays, if the client was unhappy with the
					final result.</p>

				<p>In contrast, Agile works in Sprints. A Sprint is a pattern that is repeated as many times as
					necessary until the project is completed, with each usually taking place over four to five days. For
					each Sprint, we use the following steps:</p>

				<div class="service-grid section-inner">
					<div class="service-grid-column" style="flex: 68%;">
						<ol class="service-grid-text" style="margin-left: 1em;">
							<li>
								<b>Planning</b> - A plan is drawn up of what will be prioritised in the Sprint, usually
								the features you want to see first.
							</li>

							<li style="margin-top: 20px;">
								<b>Preparation</b> - Any resources required for the Sprint are
								gathered, and research is completed on any required areas where the team lacks
								knowledge.
							</li>

							<li style="margin-top: 20px;">
								<b>Sprint</b> - The team gets to work on what was laid out in the first step.
							</li>

							<li style="margin-top: 20px;">
								<b>Review</b> - With the Sprint finished, the team sits down to discuss progress.
								Additionally, we reach out to you to let you know how things are progressing and to
								get feedback on the completed work.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>

					<div class="service-grid-column" style="flex: 30%;">
						<img src="/images/other/agile.png" style="max-height: 350px; background-color: inherit;" alt="agile cycle">
						<br>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Following this system of Sprints helps us keep you involved. Things you aren't happy with can be
					fixed faster and with far less impact on the project's timeline and budget. As a result, when the
					time comes to present the final product, you can rest assured it will be polished and as close to
					what you need as possible.</p>
