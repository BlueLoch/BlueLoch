				<h2>What we offer</h2>
				<p>We offer software development services to individuals and businesses. Need a website to show off your
					business? Or maybe you want a mobile app to compliment the courses you teach? Whatever it is, we can
					help.</p>

							we can create a single application that works across Windows, MacOS®, iOS and Android™
							cutting down

							Internal systems can be critical for a business' success, whether
							it be through customer relations management, or tracking orders. Many
							businesses will pay for pre-built systems that
							do far more than necessary leading to confused employees and overinflated prices. At
							BlueLoch, we can build you a new system that does exactly what you need it to do.</p>

				<h2>Our development process</h2>
				<p>Including you in the development of your software is vital to the way we work at BlueLoch. That's why
					we've set out some key stages in our development process so you can better understand where we're
					at. We follow this process no matter what type of software we're developing.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li class="section-inner">
						<h3>First Contact</h3>
						<p>
							The first step is, of course, you reaching out to
							us. We can't work on something for you if you don't ask! When you reach out to us, we'll get
							back to you as soon as possible to arrange an initial meeting. At the initial meeting we'll
							discuss what it is you need and what you already have.<br>
							Not sure how to reach out? Check our <a href="/pages/contact.html"
								class="intext-link">contact page</a> for details.
						</p>
					</li>

					<br>

					<li class="section-inner">
						<h3>Proposal</h3>
						<p>
							Following the initial meeting, we'll come up with a proposal for
							the project which will outline what we understand you want us to do.
							We'll send it over in an email for you to approve, or suggest ammendments to.
							Approving the proposal isn't legally binding; that comes in the next step.
						</p>
					</li>

					<br>

					<li class="section-inner">
						<h3>Contract</h3>
						<p>
							Once you're happy with the proposal, we'll draft a contract with the complete
							contract details. You'll receive a copy via email to sign electronically, or you can print
							it and send it back via post.<br>
							Once the contract is signed we'll get to work.
						</p>
					</li>

					<br>

					<li class="section-inner">
						<h3>Design</h3>
						<p>
							If you haven't already come up with a design for your software's
							interface, we'll help create one that looks good and is understandable for your customers
							and colleagues. If you already have designs, we'll skip over this step and get straight to
							the coding.
						</p>
					</li>

					<br>

					<li class="section-inner">
						<h3>Development</h3>
						<p>
							This is the part you really signed up for. We'll build
							your software piece-by-piece, testing each part and getting your approval for it before
							adding it to the main software. If you aren't happy with it, or want something about it
							changed, we're happy to make that change.<br>
							During the development stage, you can expect updates from us on a regular basis either via
							email or meetings.
						</p>
					</li>

					<br>

					<li class="section-inner">
						<h3>Testing</h3>
						<p>
							Besides the development stage, at BlueLoch the testing stage is
							the most important step of our development process. With everything added to the core
							application, we'll extensively test it for any issues or bugs and fix them as we go.
						</p>
					</li>

					<br>

					<li class="section-inner">
						<h3>Release</h3>
						<p>
							Once the software has been thoroughly tested, we'll give you a chance to play around with
							the final product. If there's something you'd like tweaked, we'll make those changes for
							you. Once you are completely happy with it, we'll release the software for use.
						</p>

					</li>

					<br>

					<li class="section-inner">
						<h3>Post Development</h3>
						<p>
							Your feedback is invaluable to us. Once your software has been released we'll get in touch
							to find out how we did. After a couple of months have gone by, we'll get in touch to find
							out how everything is working for you.
						</p>
