				<h2>Hello!</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, and thank you for taking an interest in the redesign of our website. Don't worry, this isn't
					it; you're still on the old site. We are currently running a testing program to help us identify
					issues in functionality, accessibility, and the overall feeling of the site.
					<br><br>
					All you need to take part is a device with an internet connection. When ready, clicking the "Start
					Testing" button below will download a PDF to your device. This PDF contains instructions on how to
					go about testing the site.
				</p>

				<h2>What to expect</h2>
				<h3>Testing Guide</h3>
				<p>
					When you start, you will be provided with a PDF which contains instructions on how to carry out the
					testing effectively. This includes information on how to get to the new site, and a number of basic
					tasks we would like you to complete. Please follow the instructions carefully!
				</p>

				<h3>Survey</h3>
				<p>
					Alongside completing the tasks, you will be asked to complete sections of a survey to which you can
					find a link to in the PDF. The PDF will tell you exactly when to complete relevant sections.
					Please don't skip ahead as this may have an impact on the results of the testing.
				</p>

				<h3>Website</h3>
				<p>
					Similarly to the survey, the testing manual will contain a link to the new website. Please only
					access areas of the site when asked to do so by the PDF.
				</p>

				<h2>Privacy</h2>
				<h3>Website</h3>
				<p>
					The website redesign does not make use of any data collection or tracking technology. As such, it
					does not collect, use or sell your personal data.<br><br>

					When you load into the site, it will check your
					browser's theme settings to determine if you prefer light or dark mode. However, this data is
					discarded immediately and the website will manage your preference internally for the remainder of the
					session.<br><br>

					In the same way, the website will store whether or not you have seen the cookie pop-up so it does
					not have to show it to you on every page. This data will be discarded at the end of the session.
				</p>

				<hr>

				<h3>Survey</h3>
				<p>
					The survey is hosted by Google Forms and is completely anonymous. Results will be stored in a secure
					location only accessible to BlueLoch Software Solutions. However, Google may collect some
					data. You can view Google's privacy policy <a class="intext-link"
						href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>

					The survey will ask you if you have any physical or mental health conditions which may affect how
					you view or interpret the site. This is to help us improve the accessibility of the new site. As
					this data is not linked with any other identifying data, it is classed as anonymous medical research data
					under GDPR. However, if you are not comfortable with providing this information, you can
					skip this question altogether.
