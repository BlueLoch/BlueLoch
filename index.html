				<h2>Why choose us?</h2>
				<p>At BlueLoch, we promise three things: <b>Quality</b>, <b>Inclusiveness</b> and <b>Innovation</b>.
				</p>

				<div class="section-inner">
					<h3>Quality</h3>
					<p>How many times have you heard of, or even witnessed, a piece of faulty software causing problems
						for a business? Your answer is probably 'too many'. We've also seen it too many times.
						That's why we promise a high-quality end product. All of our software is extensively tested
						before release. Plus, if we miss something, you can report it and we'll fix it at no extra
						cost.</p>
				</div>

				<br>

				<div class="section-inner">
					<h3>Inclusiveness</h3>
					<p>In the not-so-distant past software companies would develop for clients using what was called the
						"waterfall approach". They would develop the complete product for the client before getting
						approval for it. Sure it worked sometimes, but what if the client wasn't happy with it? Projects
						would face major delays and run far overbudget.<br><br>

						At BlueLoch, we do things differently. We include you in the development process. From
						interface mock-ups to features, everything must get your seal of approval before it is
						integrated into the final product. If you aren't happy with something
						we'll go back and fix it. You'll receive regular updates on our progress, and demos of parts of
						the software as it is completed. That way, when it comes to the final product, you
						can be confident it is exactly what you need.
					</p>
				</div>

				<br>

				<div class="section-inner">
					<h3>Innovation</h3>
					<p>Since the invention of the first computer, there have been a lot of ways of developing software.
						From wires plugged into boards, to today's modern frameworks and programming languages, the
						world of computing has come far. Yet many companies refuse to embrace the latest
						innovations.<br><br>

						At BlueLoch, we choose to use the latest and greatest frameworks to build your software. By
						doing so we can develop applications for every major platform faster. That includes Windows,
						MacOS®, Android™ and iOS. Plus, using modern frameworks ensures your software is
						supported for many years to come.
					</p>
